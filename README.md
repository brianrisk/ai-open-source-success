## Starting an Successful Open Source Project
`When starting an open source project that will become successful, the major things to do are:`
1. Choose the right license for your project.
2. Make sure your code is well-written and well-documented.
3. Create a detailed README file that explains what your project does and how to install and use it.
4. Host your code on a popular code hosting platform such as GitHub or Bitbucket.
5. Promote your project through social media and other online channels.

### Choose the right license for your project.
`When starting an open source project that will become successful, the major things to consider when choosing the right license for your project are:`
1. The type of project: If your project is something that you want others to be able to use and modify for their own purposes, then an open source license is a good choice. If your project is something that you want to keep closed and proprietary, then a different type of license may be more appropriate.
2. The level of collaboration: If you are looking for others to be able to contribute to your project, then a more permissive license may be a better choice. If you want to keep control over the project and not have others make changes, then a less permissive license may be more appropriate.
3. The audience for your project: If your project is aimed at a general audience, then a more permissive license may be a better choice. If your project is aimed at a specific audience or group of users, then a less permissive license may be more appropriate.

`When releasing software with an open source license, the 5 most popular licenses are:`
1. GNU General Public License (GPL)
2. MIT License
3. Apache License
4. BSD License
5. GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)

`When releasing software with an open source license, differences between Apache 2.0 and MIT are:`

The Apache 2.0 license is a permissive open source license, meaning that it allows for modifications and redistribution of the software. The MIT license is also a permissive open source license, but it is less restrictive than the Apache 2.0 license.

The Apache 2.0 license requires that any modifications to the software must be made available under the same license. The MIT license does not have this requirement, meaning that modifications can be made without needing to release the source code.

The Apache 2.0 license includes a clause that allows for the use of the software in military and nuclear applications. The MIT license does not have this clause, meaning that the software cannot be used in these applications.


### Make sure your code is well-written and well-documented.
`When it comes to writing code that is well-written and well-documented, the best advice is`
to remember that code is read much more often than it is written. As such, it is important to make sure that your code is easy to read and understand. Good code should be well organized and well commented.

In terms of organization, it is important to use clear and consistent naming conventions for your variables and functions. Your code should also be well organized into logical blocks that are easy to follow. Finally, you should use whitespace effectively to make your code more readable.

In terms of commenting, it is important to use comments to explain why you are doing something, not just what you are doing. In addition, you should use comments to provide any necessary context that would help someone understand your code.

`and` to be consistent.

This means that you should use the same coding conventions throughout your codebase, and that you should comment your code liberally.
