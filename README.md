## Starting
When starting an open source project that will become successful, the major things to do are:
1. Choose the right license for your project.
2. Make sure your code is well-written and well-documented.
3. Create a detailed README file that explains what your project does and how to install and use it.
4. Host your code on a popular code hosting platform such as GitHub or Bitbucket.
5. Promote your project through social media and other online channels.

### Choose the right license for your project.
When starting an open source project that will become successful, the major things to consider when choosing the right license for your project are:
1. The type of project: If your project is something that you want others to be able to use and modify for their own purposes, then an open source license is a good choice. If your project is something that you want to keep closed and proprietary, then a different type of license may be more appropriate.
2. The level of collaboration: If you are looking for others to be able to contribute to your project, then a more permissive license may be a better choice. If you want to keep control over the project and not have others make changes, then a less permissive license may be more appropriate.
3. The audience for your project: If your project is aimed at a general audience, then a more permissive license may be a better choice. If your project is aimed at a specific audience or group of users, then a less permissive license may be more appropriate.
